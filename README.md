# BrowserParrot
### A small HTML and javascript parrot to work in _your_ browser.

BrowserParrot is based on [parrot.live](parrot.live), which is based on [`terminal-parrot`](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot) (which is where I got the animation frames from).

I converted the multiple text files to a [single json file with all the frames in](https://github.com/undefined06855/BrowserParrot/blob/cb7217ebd1d7159acbd47578cce319eff5fbad2b/frames.json), with `\n` to denote a line break, which you can download for your own projects if you want.

It runs at 15fps, with the colors used being css's default `"red", "yellow", "green", "blue", "magenta", "cyan"` and `"white"`

I don't know what else to write here, only about 2 people will see this anyway.
Any other questions you might have, just look in the [`index.html`](https://github.com/undefined06855/BrowserParrot/blob/cb7217ebd1d7159acbd47578cce319eff5fbad2b/index.html)
